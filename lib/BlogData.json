Adventure on foot</span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Although the city is ideal for cycling and a good subway network has been built, you can also explore Copenhagen on foot. The distances are not great and on foot you often discover the city in a completely different way. Up for a brisk walk? Then walk through Nyhavn past Amalienborg Slot towards Churchillparken, where the cherry blossoms are in full bloom in the spring. While you're still in the area, walk by the Little Mermaid. Despite the fact that it does not represent much and is somewhat of a tourist trap, it is still something you cannot skip during a visit to Copenhagen.</span></span></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"https://cloud.squidex.io/api/assets/travel-diaries/48f2e17c-1d2d-488d-bdeb-aa31e8ac90c7/159c1fb6-9984-4028-9b60-0d7d9b69ff5b.jpg\"></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><i>Cherry blossoms in Churchill parks</i></span></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><br></div><div><img src=\"https://cloud.squidex.io/api/assets/travel-diaries/ddbe4b1a-ba6b-4b83-b498-373ab8182bd0/55549a47-7c30-4ea2-af59-a67d8b961a10.jpg\"></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><i>The little Mermaid</i></span></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><br></div><div><span style=\"font-family: ff-market-web, Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 35px;\">3. Picnick in the park</span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Although Copenhagen is not known to be a bustling metropolis, if you want to escape the city streets you can relax in of the many parks. Ideal for a city trip, because a moment of rest is much needed after a day of exploring. Visit the grave of, among others, Hans Christian Andersen in the Assistens Kirkegård, traverse the canals in Churchill Parks filled with cherry flowers or pay a tropical visit to the Botanisk Have. Bonus tip: the parks are accessible free of charge and that makes it an ideal place for a wonderful picnic!</span></span></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"https://cloud.squidex.io/api/assets/travel-diaries/22555f04-5d8c-439f-84c8-0e10fc0284e4/b36d2ede-8950-48e7-b21e-fdf837dd98b0.jpg\"></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><i style=\"background-color: inherit; font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Botanisk Have</i></div><div><br></div><div><span style=\"font-family: ff-market-web, Georgia, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 35px;\">4. Bicycle paradise</span></span></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">When you’re not scared of the thought of cycling in a big city, this is a perfect place to do so. Copenhagen is, second to Amsterdam, the most bicycle-friendly city in the world. You will probably encounter more bicycles than cars during your visit, and if a taxi comes along, you may notice that it has a bicycle rack. With more than 350 kilometers of bike paths, cyclists dominate traffic and motorists take this into account. Finally, it is an ideal way to explore the neighbourhoods around the city center, while enjoying the constantly changing view along the way.</span></span></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"https://cloud.squidex.io/api/assets/travel-diaries/e3239bbd-9028-4a9a-abd2-66832661c8ad/c4f2217e-d4e5-4de8-8150-1b5f6b4521cf.jpg\"></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><i>Cycling along the Nyhavn quay</i></span></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><br></div><div><b style=\"background-color: inherit; font-family: ff-market-web, Georgia, serif; font-size: 35px;\">5. Shop 'till you drop</b></div><div><span style=\"font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">In Copenhagen you’ll find one of the longest shopping streets in the world: Strøget.

You can choose whether you want to dine at one of the many Michelin star restaurants or eat a snack at Papirøen: an affordable Street Food hall with food stalls from all over the world. You can also save money by exploring the city on foot or by bicycle and an expensive lunch can be replaced by a homemade picnic in the park. Want to be a total cheapskate, but still enjoy what Copenhagen has to offer? Then don’t go to a terrace in Nyhavn, but pick up something to eat and drink yourself, take a seat at the edge of the quay, let your legs dangle above the water and enjoy the impressive view and the people walking by!</span></span></div><div><br></div><div><img src=\"https://cloud.squidex.io/api/assets/travel-diaries/0875815a-f320-430c-bc96-bcbf99fb7450/074f94eb-73c4-4974-9203-11a902a21427.jpg\"></div><div><i style=\"background-color: inherit; font-family: Soleil-Light, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Nyhavn and the Papiroen foodhall</i></div><div><br></div>",
